# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
This analysis is to figure out the differences in driver, ride, and fare numbers between rural, suburban, and urban cities.

## Results
Urban cities had the most total rides, total drivers, and total fares.  Suburban cities were second in each category, and rural cities had the lowest number.

Average fares per ride and per driver followed the opposite pattern.  Rural cities had the highest average fares, followed by suburban cities, and then urban cities.

## Recommendations
- We could raise prices in urban cities to take advantage of the large number of riders.
- We could offer a discount in rural cities to get more high-paying customers.
- We could focus on hiring more drivers for rural cities, since they tend to earn more in fares.
